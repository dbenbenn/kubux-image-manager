is a graphical application for browsing, organizing, and batch processing image files on Linux systems.
It provides a thumbnail gallery interface with support for multiple concurrent browser windows,
a built-in image viewer, and a powerful command system for operating on selected files.
.SH FEATURES

names to quickly jump to other locations. The file browser displays thumbnails that can be
resized using the slider control.
